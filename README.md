## Hey there I am amazinglySK !!

### About me

I am a coding enthusiast who wants to learn something new and cool in programming every single day. It might be a bit difficult for a high school student like me to get up to the high end expectations of others but I really love to code. Even when I don't know about it.. I just try learning something new.. I get tired but start again.. Coding is my hobb which I do in my pass time. The language which I have picked up right now is python and some basic html and css. I am not an expert in any of them. Just keep learning something new from here and there day by day. And that's exactly my motto

### Working on

Right now nothing much ... But ya soon you will see something or the other right here...

### My Bucket List

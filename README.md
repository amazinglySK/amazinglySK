## Hey there I am _amazinglySK_ !!

### About me

I am a coding enthusiast who wants to learn something new and cool in programming every single day. It might be a bit difficult for a high school student like me to get up to the high end expectations of others but I really love to code. Even when I don't know about it.. I just try learning something new.. I get tired but start again.. Coding is my hobb which I do in my pass time. The language which I have picked up right now is python and some basic html and css. I am not an expert in any of them. Just keep learning something new from here and there day by day. And that's exactly my motto

### Working on âŒ¨

The discord bot in the bucket list.. Making some new commands to run.. At the same time going through the discord.py documentation since I have no clue what to write.

Learning to parse csv files and create a token system for the bot.
Right now my tasks are:

- [ ] Think of the correct logic as to how to execute this
- [ ] Code a new file that runs the points system with a new class name (ig it would be _points_)
